This helps confirm that any uploaded datasets (like our `news_letter.txt` file) are correctly mounted and accessible within the `/kaggle/input/` directory structure.\n*   **Working Directory Information:** The comments clarify Kaggle's file system structure:\n    *   `/kaggle/working/`: The main directory where output files (like our generated `newsletter_database.json`) will be saved and preserved between sessions if the notebook version is saved.\n    *   `/kaggle/temp/`: A temporary directory for files not needed after the session ends.\n\nThis cell essentially prepares the basic environment and confirms access to input data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q -U google-generativeai","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-07T06:32:18.242058Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-07T06:32:18.242536Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-07T06:32:40.180617Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-07T06:32:18.242507Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-07T06:32:40.179494Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m175.4/175.4 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m4.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.3/1.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m25.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25h","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Defining Simulated Data Fetching Functions (Agent Tools)\n\nThis cell defines the Python functions that our AI agent will use as its \"tools\" to gather information about a company. Since integrating real-time APIs is complex for a PoC, these functions **simulate** the act of fetching data from various external sources.\n\n### 4.1. Loading Pre-Parsed Data\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nNEWSLETTER_DB_FILE = Path(\"./newsletter_database.json\")\ncompany_newsletter_data = {}\n# ... (Code to load JSON into company_newsletter_data) ...\n\n\nFirst, the code loads the structured data previously parsed from the newsletter file (newsletter_database.json) into the company_newsletter_data dictionary. This makes the actual newsletter content available for one of the simulated functions.\n\n4.2. Function Definitions\n\nThe following functions are defined:\n\ndef get_newsletter_info(company_name: str) -> str:\n    # ...(function code)...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nget_newsletter_info: Simulates fetching newsletter content. It retrieves the relevant text directly from the company_newsletter_data dictionary loaded from the JSON file.\n\ndef get_financial_news(company_name: str) -> str:\n    # ...(function code)...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nget_financial_news: Simulates fetching recent financial news.

It returns hardcoded sample text, representing aggregated themes one might find on review sites (without actually scraping).\n\nKey Aspects:\n\nSimulation: Each function includes print statements to clearly indicate when it's being \"called\" and that the data retrieval is simulated.\n\nTools for Agent: These functions act as the callable tools that will be orchestrated by the next step's logic. This setup is fundamental for demonstrating the Function Calling concept, even though the calls are simulated within this PoC.\n\n4.3.

Orchestration: Gathering Data for Selected Company\n\nThis cell acts as the central orchestrator or \"Collector Agent\" logic for the Proof of Concept. Its primary responsibilities are:\n\n1.  **Loading Available Data:** Reading the `newsletter_database.json` file created in the parsing step to know which companies have newsletter data available.\n2.  **Interactive User Input:** Prompting the user to enter the name of the company they wish to analyze, while helpfully listing the companies found in the newsletter data.\n3.  **Calling Simulated Functions:** Sequentially invoking the data-fetching functions (defined in the previous step) for the user-selected company.\n4.  **Aggregating Context:** Combining the text outputs from all the simulated function calls into a single, well-structured string (`aggregated_context`) suitable for input into the final LLM analysis step.\n\n### 5.1. Loading Data and Getting User Input\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nNEWSLETTER_DB_FILE = Path(\"./newsletter_database.json\")\ncompany_newsletter_data = {}\navailable_companies = []\n# ... (Code to load JSON and populate available_companies) ...\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Please Enter Company Name ---\")\nif available_companies:\n    print(\"Choose from the following (case-insensitive):\")\n    for company in available_companies:\n        print(f\"- {company.title()}\") # Display cleaned names\nelse:\n    print(\"Warning: No companies loaded...\")\n\n# Get input from the user\ntarget_company_input = input(\"Enter the company name you want to analyze: \")\nTARGET_COMPANY_NAME = target_company_input.strip()\nprint(f\"Selected company (raw input): '{target_company_input}' -> Processing for: '{TARGET_COMPANY_NAME}'\")\n\n\nThe code first loads the parsed newsletter data to identify which companies can be selected.\n\nIt lists these companies to guide the user.\n\nThe built-in input() function pauses execution, allowing the user to type the desired company name.\n\nThe input is stored in the TARGET_COMPANY_NAME variable after basic cleaning (strip()).\n\n5.2. Orchestrating Function Calls\nprint(f\"\\n--- Starting Data Collection for: {TARGET_COMPANY_NAME} ---\")\n\n# Assuming functions get_newsletter_info, get_financial_news, etc. are defined\n\nnewsletter_text = get_newsletter_info(TARGET_COMPANY_NAME)\nfinancial_news_text = get_financial_news(TARGET_COMPANY_NAME)\nfunding_data_text = get_funding_data(TARGET_COMPANY_NAME)\nemployee_reviews_text = get_employee_reviews(TARGET_COMPANY_NAME)\n\nprint(f\"\\n--- Data Collection Finished for: {TARGET_COMPANY_NAME} ---\")\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nThis section demonstrates the core Agent-like behavior (though implemented simply here). It systematically calls each defined \"tool\" (our simulated functions) with the target company name.\n\nEach call retrieves a specific piece of simulated information (newsletter, news, funding, reviews).\n\nThis simulates an agent deciding which data sources to consult and executing those actions.\n\n5.3. Aggregating Context\naggregated_context = f\"\"\"\nInformation gathered for company: {TARGET_COMPANY_NAME}\n\n=== Recent Newsletter Information ===\n{newsletter_text}\n\n=== Recent Financial News Summary ===\n{financial_news_text}\n\n=== Funding Data Summary ===\n{funding_data_text}\n\n=== Employee Review Themes Summary ===\n{employee_reviews_text}\n\n=== End of Information ===\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Aggregated Context Prepared for LLM ---\")\n# ... (Code to print snippet of aggregated_context) ...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nAll the retrieved text snippets are combined into a single string variable, aggregated_context.\n\nCrucially, clear headings (=== Section Title ===) are added. This structure helps the downstream LLM understand the source and nature of different parts of the context.\n\nThis step prepares the potentially large amount of text from diverse simulated sources for processing by the LLM, touching upon Document Understanding (of the combined text) and potentially requiring Long Context Window capabilities from the final model.\n\nThis orchestration step gathers all necessary information for the chosen company and formats it, setting the stage for the final generative analysis by the AI model.\n\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Final Analysis & Structured Output Generation using Gemini\n\n# This is where we leverage the generative AI model.
