Defining Simulated Data Fetching Functions (Agent Tools)\n\nThis cell defines the Python functions that our AI agent will use as its \"tools\" to gather information about a company. Since integrating real-time APIs is complex for a PoC, these functions **simulate** the act of fetching data from various external sources.\n\n### 4.1. Loading Pre-Parsed Data\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nNEWSLETTER_DB_FILE = Path(\"./newsletter_database.json\")\ncompany_newsletter_data = {}\n# ... (Code to load JSON into company_newsletter_data) ...\n\n\nFirst, the code loads the structured data previously parsed from the newsletter file (newsletter_database.json) into the company_newsletter_data dictionary. This makes the actual newsletter content available for one of the simulated functions.\n\n4.2. Function Definitions\n\nThe following functions are defined:\n\ndef get_newsletter_info(company_name: str) -> str:\n    # ...(function code)...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nget_newsletter_info: Simulates fetching newsletter content. It retrieves the relevant text directly from the company_newsletter_data dictionary loaded from the JSON file.\n\ndef get_financial_news(company_name: str) -> str:\n    # ...(function code)...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nget_financial_news: Simulates fetching recent financial news. It returns hardcoded sample text based on keywords found in the company_name, mimicking what might come from a news API.\n\ndef get_funding_data(company_name: str) -> str:\n    # ...(function code)...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nget_funding_data: Simulates fetching company funding history. It returns hardcoded sample text, similar to what might be retrieved from financial databases like Crunchbase.\n\ndef get_employee_reviews(company_name: str) -> str:\n    # ...(function code)...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nget_employee_reviews: Simulates fetching employee sentiment themes. It returns hardcoded sample text, representing aggregated themes one might find on review sites (without actually scraping).\n\nKey Aspects:\n\nSimulation: Each function includes print statements to clearly indicate when it's being \"called\" and that the data retrieval is simulated.\n\nTools for Agent: These functions act as the callable tools that will be orchestrated by the next step's logic. This setup is fundamental for demonstrating the Function Calling concept, even though the calls are simulated within this PoC.\n\n4.3.

Its primary responsibilities are:\n\n1.  **Loading Available Data:** Reading the `newsletter_database.json` file created in the parsing step to know which companies have newsletter data available.\n2.  **Interactive User Input:** Prompting the user to enter the name of the company they wish to analyze, while helpfully listing the companies found in the newsletter data.\n3.  **Calling Simulated Functions:** Sequentially invoking the data-fetching functions (defined in the previous step) for the user-selected company.\n4.  **Aggregating Context:** Combining the text outputs from all the simulated function calls into a single, well-structured string (`aggregated_context`) suitable for input into the final LLM analysis step.\n\n### 5.1.

Make sure the secret name matches ('GOOGLE_API_KEY' in the example). It selects the gemini-1.5-flash model (you can change this).\n\n# Define Prompt: This is the core instruction set.\n\n# It uses an f-string to embed the TARGET_COMPANY_NAME and the entire aggregated_context collected in the previous step.\n\n# It explicitly tells the AI its role (due diligence assistant).\n\n# It strictly defines the desired JSON Schema. This is crucial for getting structured output.\n\n# It clearly instructs the AI to base its analysis only on the provided context.\n\n# It tells the AI to output only the JSON object.\n\n# Call API: It sends the combined prompt and context to the model.generate_content() method. Includes basic error handling for the API call.\n\n# Process Response:\n\n# It extracts the text content from the API response.\n\n# It attempts to remove potential markdown fences (like json ...) that models sometimes add around JSON output.\n\n# It uses json.loads() to parse the text into a Python dictionary.\n\n# If parsing is successful, it pretty-prints the structured JSON report using json.dumps() with indentation.\n\n# If parsing fails (e.g., the model didn't output valid JSON), it prints an error and shows you the raw text response from Gemini so you can debug the prompt or the response itself.\n\n# Before Running:\n\n# Ensure Previous Cell Ran: Make sure the cell that collects the data and defines TARGET_COMPANY_NAME and aggregated_context has been run successfully in the current session.\n\n# Check API Key Secret: Double-check that your Google API key is correctly added to Kaggle Secrets and that the name used in userdata.get('YOUR_SECRET_NAME') matches exactly.\n\n# Run this cell. It might take a few seconds for the API call to complete. Observe the output:\n\n# Did the API key configure correctly?\n\n# Did the API call succeed?\n\n# Did it successfully parse the response as JSON?\n\n# Does the final printed JSON report look like the structure you defined and contain relevant analysis based on the simulated input data?\n\n# This is the culmination of the project's core workflow!

Final Analysis & Structured Output Generation (Gemini)\n\nThis is the final and most critical step where the Generative AI model synthesizes the collected information and generates the structured due diligence report.\n\n### 6.1. Configuring the Gemini API Client\n\n```python\nimport google.generativeai as genai\nimport json\nimport os\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\nimport datetime\n\n# --- Configure Gemini API ---\ntry:\n    user_secrets = UserSecretsClient()\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY_FROM_SECRET = user_secrets.get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n    genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY_FROM_SECRET)\n    print(\"Gemini API Key configured successfully using UserSecretsClient.\")\n# ... (Error handling) ...\n\n# Select the Gemini model\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')\nprint(f\"Using Gemini model: {model.model_name}\")\n\n\nNecessary libraries (google.generativeai, json, datetime) and the kaggle_secrets.UserSecretsClient are imported.\n\nThe code securely retrieves the GOOGLE_API_KEY stored in Kaggle Secrets using the recommended UserSecretsClient.\n\ngenai.configure() initializes the library with the retrieved API key.\n\nThe gemini-1.5-flash model is selected, suitable for complex instructions and JSON generation while being efficient.\n\n6.2. Crafting the Final Analysis Prompt\ntodays_date = datetime.date.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n\nfinal_analysis_prompt = f\"\"\"\nAnalyze the provided information about the company '{TARGET_COMPANY_NAME}'. Your goal is to synthesize insights relevant to a potential employee performing due diligence.\n\nBased *only* on the context provided below, perform the following analysis and structure your entire response as a single JSON object matching the schema exactly. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure...\n\n**JSON Schema:**\n{{\n  \"company_name\": \"string - ...

A detailed prompt is constructed using an f-string.\n\nIt clearly defines the AI's role (due diligence assistant) and the target audience (potential employee).\n\nIt injects the TARGET_COMPANY_NAME, today's todays_date, and the entire aggregated_context (collected in the previous step).\n\nCrucially, it includes the precise JSON Schema definition and instructs the model to adhere strictly to it and output only the JSON. This instruction enables the Structured Output / JSON Mode capability.\n\nIt explicitly tells the model to base its analysis only on the provided context, which aligns with the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where the model's response is grounded in specific retrieved information (in this case, the aggregated_context).\n\nSpecific instructions guide the analysis for fields like potential_employee_impact and esop_context.\n\n6.3. Calling the Gemini API\nprint(f\"\\n--- Sending data for {TARGET_COMPANY_NAME} to Gemini for analysis... ---\")\ngenerated_json_text = None\ntry:\n    response = model.generate_content(\n        final_analysis_prompt,\n        safety_settings=safety_settings if safety_settings else None,\n        generation_config=genai.types.GenerationConfig(\n            candidate_count=1,\n            temperature=0.3 # Lower temperature for more deterministic JSON\n        )\n     )\n    # ...

(Error handling) ...\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nThe model.generate_content() method sends the carefully crafted prompt and the aggregated context to the Gemini API.\n\ntemperature=0.3 is set to encourage the model to produce more focused and deterministic output, which is generally better for generating reliable JSON.\n\nError handling checks if the response was blocked by safety filters or if no response was generated.\n\n6.4. Processing and Displaying the JSON Response\nfinal_analysis_json = None\nif generated_json_text:\n    print(\"\\n--- Attempting to parse Gemini response as JSON ---\")\n    try:\n        # ...

(Generic error handling) ...\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nNo response text received from Gemini...\")\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nThe code attempts to clean the raw text response from the model, removing potential markdown fences (```json ... ```) that LLMs sometimes add.\n\nIt uses the standard json.loads() function to parse the cleaned text into a Python dictionary/list structure. This validates whether the model successfully generated output matching the requested JSON format.\n\nIf parsing is successful, json.dumps() is used to pretty-print the structured report, making it easy to read.\n\nRobust error handling is included to catch cases where the model's output is not valid JSON, printing the raw response to aid debugging.\n\nThis final step brings together the collected context and the power of the generative model to produce the desired structured analysis, demonstrating key capabilities like Structured Output / JSON Mode and effective Prompt Engineering.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
